This is the documentation for a dash-like Slingshot ability. You have to have your own character controller for this to work.

1. First drag the Slingshot script onto your Player character and drag the Player.
3. Next, create an empty gameObject and add it as a child of the camera that is on your Player.
4. Call this gameObject SlingTarget and move it away from the player as far as want. (This is how far the slingshot ability
will take you.
5. In the inspector select the curve, once selected choose the 3rd avaiable curve at the bottom.
6. Set the Speed to 1 and the Cooldown to 5, and also drag in your Player into the controller slot.

The slingshot ability should work now whenever you press the Q button. You can also change the speed and the cooldown
as you see fit.
